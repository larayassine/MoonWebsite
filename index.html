          <p>
            The Moon has an extremely thin and tenuous atmosphere, known as an
            exosphere. It lacks the protective layers we have on Earth, so
            thereâ€™s no weather, no wind, and temperatures fluctuate drastically
            between day and night.

            a Dark Side
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Moon is tidally locked, meaning its rotation period matches its
            orbit around Earth. This results in one hemisphere always facing us
            while the other, known as the far side or "dark side" (though it
            receives sunlight too), is never visible from Earth.

          </h2>
          <p>
            TThe Moon's gravitational force pulls on Earth, primarily affecting
            the oceans, creating high and low tides. As Earth rotates, different
            areas of the planet experience this gravitational pull, leading to
            rising and falling sea levels.
